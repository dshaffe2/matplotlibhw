1) We know that there are more rides at a less average fare in urban areas compared to rural areas but if I were considering working as a ride share driver, I would probably choose to work primarily in suburban areas based on the data in the scatterplot. However, I would also want to gather and analyze data on driver saturation in those spaces as well in order to assess the real opportunity to make money.
2) Urban areas have the largest ratio of fare % to driver %, suggesting that the urban spaces are over-saturated with drivers. Conversely, rural areas have the lowest ratio of the same. However, as a driver, I would want to assess things like distance and time required per ride before making a decision as to which space I would work in.
3) West Angela has the most rides
